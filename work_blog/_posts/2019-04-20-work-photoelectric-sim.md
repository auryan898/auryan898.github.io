A simulation I did for my AP Physics 2 class in High School.  This simulation utilizes PhaserJS to create a uniform cross-platform experience across all devices. I created this simulation to help understand the [Photoelectric Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect) because the old [simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/photoelectric) would not work on chromebooks or mobile devices.
