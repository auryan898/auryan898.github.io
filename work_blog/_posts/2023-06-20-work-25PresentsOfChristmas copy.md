A short little HTML5 game made for a Secret Santa exchange with my family. The theme that year was "handmade" so I made a whole game! By winning the game, the recipient of the Secret Santa gift would get a gift card link too. The link was encrypted with a password handed to the recipient, but the link could only be redeemed once anyways.

This game works on both PC and Mobile touchscreens. Use the arrow keys if you have a keyboard or follow the attached touchscreen instructions.
