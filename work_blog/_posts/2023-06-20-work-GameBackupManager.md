A simple Desktop application written in pure Python that allows a user to create multiple ZIP backups of a specific folder and re-load a specific backup when desired.

It can be configured to have multiple profiles, with each one having a "backup folder" to store backups of, and a "storage folder" to store zip folder archives.

It was originally intended for usage with a PC video game called "Noita" which lacks a built-in system to save and load the state of the game. The game can be manually saved by copying a small folder of desginated configuration files and then copying them back to the original location. Game Backup Manager essentially performs this procedure.
